This project, built using the Vue CLI, features two approaches to Danmaku: one implemented through DOM manipulation and the other using the canvas. 
You can switch between the two implementations via routing, with the default path displaying the DOM implementation and '/canvas-demo' corresponding to the canvas-based Danmaku. Additionally, anti-occlusion is achieved with TensorFlow libraries in the canvas implementation.
